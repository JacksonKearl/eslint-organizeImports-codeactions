# steps:

install eslint extension

npm i

open index.ts

save a few times.

notice the import line goes back and forth between collapsed (after organize imports does its thing) and expanded (after eslint does its thing). Both orginize imports then eslint should to their things.

Also, notice that eslint opens a web brower to its readme for some reason? I have seen that before (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/88131) so it may be related.
